Although there has been considerable progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) over the years, it has not been quite integrated in the Accounting and Finance (AF) industry. In the meantime, companies worldwide produce vast amounts of textual data as part of their reporting packages to comply with regulations and inform shareholders of their financial performance. The glossy annual report is such an example, widely read by investors but also quite long. Inspired by the Financial Narrative Summarisation (FNS) 2021 Task, we will design an Automatic Text Summarisation (ATS) system for the narrative parts of UK financial annual reports. With this goal in mind, we will implement and explore the following models for Extractive Text Summarisation (ETS): \begin{enumerate*} \item custom Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), \item fine-tuned FinBERT \end{enumerate*}. In terms of evaluation, we will use the ROUGE metric to compare the performance of these models against standard ATS baselines: TextRank, and LexRank.

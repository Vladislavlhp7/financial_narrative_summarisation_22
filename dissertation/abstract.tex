Although there has been considerable progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) over the years, it has not fully reached the Accounting and Finance (AF) industry.
In the meantime, companies worldwide produce vast amounts of textual data as part of their reporting packages to comply with regulations and inform shareholders of their financial performance.
The glossy annual report is such an example, widely read by investors, but it also tends to be quite long.
Inspired by the Financial Narrative Processing (FNP) workshops~\cite{zmandar-etal-2021-financial, fnp-2022-financial},
we design an Automatic Text Summarisation (ATS) system for the narrative parts of UK financial annual reports.
With this goal in mind, we implement and explore the following models for Extractive Text Summarisation (ETS):
attention-based Financial Recurrent Neural Network (FinRNN) with data augmentation, and fine-tuned Financial BERT (FinBERT)~\cite{yang2020finbert}.
Our evaluations based on the ROUGE-2 metric show both models to be outperforming the standard ATS baselines: TextRank~\cite{mihalcea-tarau-2004-textrank}, and LexRank~\cite{Erkan2004LexRankGC}.
Furthermore, our FinBERT-base model achieves an average ROUGE-2 $F1$ score of $0.382$ beating with $0.081$ on the
validation set the \emph{best performing model overall in the FNS22 competition} - \emph{LSIR's mT5}~\cite{foroutan-etal-2022-multilingual}.
%However, we acknowledge that we cannot perform a thorough evaluation testing data,
%and we had to create our own training-validation sets, while using the official validation set as our testing one.

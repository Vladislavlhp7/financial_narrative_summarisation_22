\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Financial Reports}
Due to international regulations, companies are obliged to report their periodic performance (annual, bi-annual) to various regulatory authorities\footnote{Regulation authorities worldwide:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the USA
    \item European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in Europe
    \item Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in the UK
    \item International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in 167 jurisdictions worldwide
\end{itemize}
} and other users (e.g., corporate stakeholders, investors, customers, suppliers, etc.). These reports contain essential information about the operations and finances of the business, but differ in forms. For example,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 10-K reports filed to the SEC\footnote{\url{https://www.sec.gov}} and accessible through their Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval\footnote{\url{https://www.sec.gov/edgar}} (EDGAR) system. They follow a standardised template and are plain text, which makes them particularly easy for automated large-scale research (\cite{el-haj2019retrieving}). 
\end{enumerate}

As outlined in \cite{elliott1998accounting}, investorsâ€™ trust in the accountability of businesses would be based no longer as much on just the financial statements, but also on more descriptive narratives that define strategy and planning of resource use.
